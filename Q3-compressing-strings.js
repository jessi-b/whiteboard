// Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

// Example
// Input: "aaabccdddda"
// Output: "3ab2c4da"
// ----------------------------------------------------

// given string, return string
// loop to find repeated char
// compress char
// push count of instances if > 1

let string = "aaabccdddda";
let arr = str.split("");
let map = arr.map( ) // [0]a, [1],
arr.map()
let count = 0;
