This is a mock technical interview, so the goal is to practice as if you were interviewing for a real job. For both the interviewers (who are giving feedback) and interviewee (who is whiteboarding), this means that you should be formal in your presentation:

Check to make sure folks can hear you, see your code.
Speak clearly, doing your best not to trail off in your speech or mumble.
Make eye contact.
Be polite and encouraging.
If the interviewee is stuck and you (the interviewer) know how to get unstuck:
Give the interviewee space to figure out next steps before offering help.
Ask the interviewee if they want help before giving help.
If you are doing this remotely, have your video turned on. If you are having a technical issue that makes it so you can't share your video, let your group members know.

At the end of the group interview session, you will be expected to submit your whiteboard solution. You can submit either a txt file or if you prefer you may submit a picture of a whiteboard or written solution. The purpose of the txt file is to write and submit an answer that includes no auto-fill from VS Code.

Remember, this is an important time for you as the interviewer to think critically and scrutinize anything that an interviewer at a potential workplace would. If you are struggling to come up with examples of where an interview can improve, consider these:

Error handling
Handling edge cases
Testing all cases based on the possible inputs/outputs
If time remains, engaging in more discussion about the prompt. For example, what a more efficient solution might look like?
Feedback on presentation:
Eye contact
Clarity in explanations about code and decision making.
Whether assumptions were made that could have been clarified with questions
Code style (comments, variable naming)
Use of technical terminology
